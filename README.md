<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

From the many great README templates available on GitHub we chose Othneildrew's template as a base for the Readme used on the Flutterando community projects, because of it's layout and being ease of use.
We modified it to be more in tune with the packages and projects from our community and to have a go-to readme when we start a new one. 

Othneildrews's said this in his project, and we feel it apllies for us too:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life 😊

Of course, one template will never fit all projects, but we hope that this one can be of help to yours as it was to the Flutterando community packages. We also, as always, accept suggestions, send yours by forking this repo and creating a pull request of it.
