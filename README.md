<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

From the many great README templates available on GitHub we chose Othneildrew's template for the Flutterando community, for it's layout and ease of use.
We modified it to be more in tune with the packages and projects from our community and to have a go-to readme when we start a new one. 

Othneildrews's said this in his project, and we feel it apllies for us too:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜Š

Of course, no one template will serve all projects and this one may have more changes in the future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request.

<br>

## Usage

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started. Copy it, modify it for your project and use the `EXAMPLE_README.md` to also guide you.
